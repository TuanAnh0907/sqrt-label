      All music by <b>Arszyn</b><br><br>
      All started with the idea of exploring the sonic layer of the immigrants' language. <br>
The language is alive, but how to record it? It's hidden, intimate, or it's the language
of  profession. <br>
I didn't spend much time in London. Some time ago I stayed there as long as half a year. Somewhere deep inside I was feeling the urge to visit the city once again.  Some day
I will go there again - that's for sure.
The technology, the organization, the noise and the center of the modern world.<br>
I was recording the soundscape of London, looking for hidden sounds and registering the overwhelming noise of a vibrant life in a big city. I was meeting Polish immigrants who lived there and I was recording their stories.
I was asking them how they see the city and themselves, what their lives look like.
I became a  listener of the  audiosphere and a sound explorer.<br><br>


This CD is the sound documentation of the project "ARSZYN_EMIGRANT", amplificador [0.0], [0.2],[0.3]<br><br>

Realization of the Emigrant Project:  Arszyn and Pracownia Ludzie Gdañsk<br>
Cooperation:  Stowarzyszenie Kultura Miejska, Marek Dybu¶æ, Zambari, sqrt<br><br>

The album is published as a cooperation of sqrt and Plg rec.<br><br>

The project was possible thanks to the financial help of the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage<br><br>
